# Libadwaita KDE 
A attempt at porting the Libadwaita look to KDE/Qt.
This is a work in progress, install scripts, and further things will be added in the future.
A SDDM theme isnt planed anymore, just use GDM.

## Aurorae
<p>

</p>

Based on [Colloid aurorae theme](https://www.pling.com/p/1738680/) and [Nova](https://www.pling.com/p/1662814/)

### Main colour support
- [x] Light
- [x] Dark
### Button Support
- [x] Close
- [x] Show on all desktops
### Recomended Settings
- Button Size: Tiny

### Rounded Corners
I recomend using [KDE-Rounded-Corners](https://github.com/matinlotfali/KDE-Rounded-Corners) to get all window corners to be round, this will make the theme look more accurate to libadwaita. **Note:** you cant use the custom aurorae with this, its a tradeoff between button accuracy and rounding accuracy.
